## Design Thinking Session: Job Portal

**Date:** 2025-11-04
**Facilitator:** Team 4
**Design Challenge:** Build a secure, scalable, user-friendly job marketplace that reduces friction for job seekers and helps employers quickly find qualified candidates through explainable, AI-driven matching.

---

## 🎯 Design Challenge

Design a two-sided job marketplace that delivers a fast, reassuring experience for job seekers and an efficient, high-signal experience for employers. Prioritize an end-to-end MVP slice (onboarding → recommend → apply → status) that is transparent, trustworthy, and measurable.

## 👥 EMPATHIZE: Understanding Users

### User Insights

- Job seekers want: simple onboarding, strong recommendations, clear application status, and interview prep; anxiety stems from silence and irrelevant matches.
- Employers want: quick triage to a qualified shortlist, easy scheduling, and clear signals (skills, experience) without sifting through noise.
- Both sides value transparency: “Why this job/candidate?” explanations, status visibility, and anti-spam/anti-fraud controls.

### Key Observations

- “Time-to-value” is critical in first session; thin E2E wins over breadth.
- Explainability significantly affects trust; feedback loops improve recommendations.
- Calendaring and inbox workflow are core to employer adoption.

### Empathy Map Summary

- Says: “I need relevant roles/candidates fast.”
- Thinks: “Is this platform legit and fair?”
- Does: Uploads resume, scans listings, applies, triages applicants, schedules.
- Feels: Hopeful but anxious; time-pressed and easily frustrated by dead ends.

## 🎨 DEFINE: Frame the Problem

### Point of View Statement

Busy job seekers and hiring teams need a transparent, explainable way to connect quickly because current tools are noisy, opaque, and slow to surface the right matches.

### How Might We Questions

- How might we minimize seeker drop-off during onboarding and application?
- How might we increase match quality and clearly explain why?
- How might we reduce employer time-to-shortlist with a smart inbox?
- How might we ensure fairness and reduce bias in recommendations?

### Key Insights

- Clarity, speed, and explainability increase engagement on both sides.
- A feedback-driven loop (thumbs up/down) measurably improves matching.

## 🛠️ PROTOTYPE: Make Ideas Tangible

### Prototype Approach

- Figma wireframes for seeker onboarding, recommendations, job detail, apply, status; employer posting, inbox, candidate view, schedule.
- Clickable prototype covering the E2E MVP slice.

### Prototype Description

- Employer posts job; triages applicants in smart inbox; schedules interviews.

### Key Features to Test

- Onboarding clarity and trust
- Recommendation relevance and explainability
- Employer triage efficiency and scheduling

## ✅ TEST: Validate with Users

### Testing Plan

- 5–7 seekers, 3–5 employers; task-based sessions; think-aloud; timing + error metrics; SUS survey.

### User Feedback

- Early signal on clarity of extraction, usefulness of recommendations, and speed of triage.

### Key Learnings

- Expect confusion around skill normalization; explanation UI must be concise.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Refinements Needed

- Tighten explanation text; improve skill ontology; add inline help during onboarding.

### Action Items

- Ship MVP slice; instrument events; run A/B on recommenders; add feedback buttons.

### Success Metrics

- Seeker: profile completion rate, CTR on recs, apply conversion.
- Employer: time-to-shortlist, interview scheduled rate, offer rate.
