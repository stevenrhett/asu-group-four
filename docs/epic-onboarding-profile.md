## Goal
Deliver fast, low-friction onboarding so seekers can upload a resume, auto-extract skills, and complete a minimal profile that powers recommendations.

## Outcome Metrics
- Profile completion rate > 70% on first session
- Time to first recommendation < 2 minutes

## Scope
- Resume upload (PDF/DOCX) and parsing to structured fields
- Minimal profile (location, role targets, preferences)
- Seeker dashboard with progress and next actions

## Out of Scope
